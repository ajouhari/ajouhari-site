Although I wrote much of the code, some features, such as the dropdown menu, lazy loading, and background letter waterfall effect, I had to learn from youtube and stack overflow. I glossed over many youtube and stack overflow posts, and would like to thank everyone who offers their knowledge and advice for the rest to learn from.
